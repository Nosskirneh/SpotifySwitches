# SpotifySwitches
Compatible with iOS 8, 9 and 10.

Flipswitches and more for Spotify.

With this package you will be able to:
* Control Spotify Connect devices
* Add current track to playlist
* Add current track to collection
* Control Offline Mode
* Control Shuffle
* Control Repeat
* More comingâ€¦

This tweak will also initialize Spotify with whatever setting previously assigned it to. For example: if shuffle is turned on and you exit Spotify while being offline, on the next Spotify launch the default Spotify behaviour would be to start with shuffle turned off. This tweak fixes that.
